## Advent Of Code 2023
Not much to say, puzzle solutions this year's [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) using C#. just to have fun at evenings. <br>
## Set Up
1. Clone repo (or download zip)
2. Open VS and open the solution (.sln).
3. Right click on the solution -> "Restore NuGet Packages".
4. In case you get **errors** on _Microsfot offline packages_ it means you are missing files from your local machine.<br/>
&nbsp; In that case you must check for 2 things, <br/>
&nbsp; 4.1. First if you have this folder: C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\NuGetPackages\ (If not you should get the microsoft SDKs. <br/>
&nbsp; 4.2. Second thing is to have the nuget.org on your packages sources. You can get it from this [link](https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json) and just add it on your project sources.
## Project Structure
- All input are in one place: "AdventOfCode2023/Inputs" (replace them with yours).
- My goal is for each puzzle to be able to run on it's own class.
- Each method excels in a single task to enhance code readability.
  
PS: At some point, I found myself using a bunch of Items (classes) to tackle tricky logic and math problems.
